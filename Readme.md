# Starbucks
## The goal
This analysis of simulated user interaction data in the Starbucks promotion app. The source of the data is Udacity to create the datascience master analysis.

After analyzing the data I ask myself the following questions: 
    - Which customer groups do you convert the most?
    - What kind of offer works best?
    - Which customer profile is most profitable?

## Project motivation
Use real-life data and apply dat science analysis to a business problem.

## Datasets
3 datasets:
 - Portfolio - file describing the types of offers. 
 - Profile - file with the socio-demographic profile data of the users
- Transcript - file with user interactions and offers. It also includes the purchases

## Libraries
> Padas, numpy,  json
> matplotlib, searborn
> sklearn, standarscaler, pca, kmeans

## Analysis
> Analyze the datasets to define the questions
> Clean up data and create features 
> Apply the techniques and models that help us to answer the questions 

## Insights & summary of results
There are 2 relevant clusters, that convert most, is most profitable and works best
- Users who have been in the program for 2 years, are over 40 years old and are used to receiving many offers and converting them (70%)  
- High income ladies, do not receive many offers but those who do receive them convert (60%)
Men, and especially young men, who are the majority group that has joined in recent years are not converting.
